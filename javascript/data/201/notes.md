## Data types can be collection in other structures like objects and arrays

### Objects 
An object describes something. It lives inside of opening and closing curly braces and is organize as key:value pairs, seperated by commas. The key and the value are themselves seperated by a `:`.
```
const car = {
    color: 'green',
    mileage: 67302,
    isNew: false
};
```


### Arrays 
An array is a list of items. It is defined by opening and closing square brackets. The items in the array are seperated by commas. Each item in an array is indexed with a number. Arrays can contain all other data types as well as objects. 
```
const shoppingList - ['apples', 'celery', 'bread'];
const ages = [7,7,8,8,7.5];
const cars = [
    {
        color: 'green',
        mileage:67302,
        isNew: false
    },
     {
        color: 'red'
        milage: 37412
        isNew: false
     },
       {
        color: 'blue',
        milage: 167209,
        isNew: false
       },
        {
        color: 'yellow',
        milage: 67302,
        isNew: false
        }
];
