# Javascript data 102

## Three simple data types.

### string

A string is defined with `'` or `"`.

```
let location = 'Atlanta, Georgia';
```

### boolean

The value of a boolean is either `true` or `false`.

```
const isNew - false;
```

### number 

Pretty straight forward but `number` cannot write really, really big numbers

```
let age = 32;
```
